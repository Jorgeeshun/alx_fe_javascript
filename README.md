Tasks 0: Building a Dynamic Content Generator with Advanced DOM Manipulation
ðŸ”¥ Features Implemented
âœ… Random Quote Generator (from all or filtered categories).
âœ… Dynamic Categories Dropdown (auto-updates when new quotes are added).
âœ… Add New Quotes Dynamically (updates DOM + array without refresh).
âœ… Interactive UI (DOM is fully manipulated via vanilla JavaScript).

Tasks 1: Implementing Web Storage and JSON Handling
ðŸ”¥Changes made:
âœ… createAddQuoteForm() dynamically builds the Add Quote form (inputs + button) with DOM methods (createElement, appendChild, etc.).
âœ… Hooked up the button to addQuote() so it works the same as before.
âœ… Now index.html doesnâ€™t need the form hard-coded â€” only the placeholders for quoteDisplay, newQuote, and categoryFilter.


Tasks 2: Creating a Dynamic Content Filtering System Using Web Storage and JSON
âœ… Whatâ€™s Implemented

Dynamic dropdown populated via populateCategories.

Filtering via filterQuotes() â€” shows only quotes in the selected category.

Persistence: last selected filter is saved in localStorage and restored.

Add Quote updates dropdown instantly if a new category appears.

Import/Export JSON still work.
