Tasks 0: Building a Dynamic Content Generator with Advanced DOM Manipulation
🔥 Features Implemented
✅ Random Quote Generator (from all or filtered categories).
✅ Dynamic Categories Dropdown (auto-updates when new quotes are added).
✅ Add New Quotes Dynamically (updates DOM + array without refresh).
✅ Interactive UI (DOM is fully manipulated via vanilla JavaScript).


Tasks 1: Implementing Web Storage and JSON Handling
🔥Changes made:
✅ createAddQuoteForm() dynamically builds the Add Quote form (inputs + button) with DOM methods (createElement, appendChild, etc.).
✅ Hooked up the button to addQuote() so it works the same as before.
✅ Now index.html doesn’t need the form hard-coded — only the placeholders for quoteDisplay, newQuote, and categoryFilter.


Tasks 2: Creating a Dynamic Content Filtering System Using Web Storage and JSON
🔥What’s Implemented
✅ Dynamic dropdown populated via populateCategories.
✅ Filtering via filterQuotes() — shows only quotes in the selected category.
✅ Persistence: last selected filter is saved in localStorage and restored.
✅ Add Quote updates dropdown instantly if a new category appears.
✅ Import/Export JSON still work.


Tasks 3. Syncing Data with Server and Implementing Conflict Resolution
🔥How this meets your spec
✅Step 1 (Server simulation): Uses fetch against JSONPlaceholder for GET/POST; a timer simulates periodic updates.
✅Step 2 (Data syncing): syncNow() pulls remote data and merges. mergeServerData() applies server-wins by default.
✅Step 3 (Conflicts): Conflicts are logged and auto-resolved (server), with a modal to override per item. Sync banner informs users and exposes “Resolve Conflicts” when needed.
✅Step 4 (Testing):
* Add/edit local quotes, wait for auto-sync or click Sync Now.
* Watch the sync banner for applied updates and conflicts.
* Open Resolve Conflicts and choose Keep Local for any item; it will also attempt a POST (simulation).
